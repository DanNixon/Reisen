Notable differences to the original Cardboard
---------------------------------------------

-  Optional cutout to allow those that wear glasses to comfortably use it
-  Configurable device thickness and cutout for camera (improving device support)
-  Latching front door to hold device in place
-  Ability to use a thinner material for the screen divider
-  Configurable cutout for USB/audio connectors
-  Configurable mounting holes for a head strap
-  Ability to mount select magnet in best position (my Galaxy Nexus almost never worked in the official Cardboard)
-  Easy modification of lens type and focal length
