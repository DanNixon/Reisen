Still somewhat a work in progress.

Notable differences to the original Cardboard
---------------------------------------------

-  Optional cutout to allow those that wear glasses to comfortably use it
-  Configurable device width and cutout for camera (improving device support)
-  Latching front door to hold device in place
-  Ability to use a thinner material for the screen divider
-  Configurable cutout for USB/audio connectors
