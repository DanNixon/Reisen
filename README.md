Still somewhat a work in progress.

Notable differences to the original Cardboard
---------------------------------------------

-  Optional cutout to allow those that wear glasses to comfortably use it
-  Configurable device width and cutout for camera (improvind device support)

TODO
----

-  Add "select" magnet
-  Add retention clips for lens
